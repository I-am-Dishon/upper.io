# SQLite

The `sqlite` adapter for [SQLite3][3] wraps the
`github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` driver written by [Yasuhiro Matsumoto][1].

![Note](https://github.com/LizGoro90/db-tour/tree/master/static/img)
> Here you’ll learn about the particularities of the [SQLite3][3] adapter. Before starting to read this detailed information, it is advisable that you take a look at the [getting started](https://upper.io/db.v3/getting-started) page so you become acquainted with the basics of upper-db and you can grasp concepts better.

## Installation

This package uses [cgo][4]. To use it, you'll need a C compiler, such as `gcc`:

```
# Debian
sudo apt-get install gcc

# FreeBSD
sudo pkg install gcc
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/gcc47 /usr/local/bin/gcc
```

![Note](https://github.com/LizGoro90/db-tour/tree/master/static/img)
> If you're using Mac, you'll need [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and
Command Line Tools.

Once this requirement is met, you can use `go get` to download, compile and install the adapter:

```
go get upper.io/db.v3/sqlite
```

Otherwise, you'll see the following error:

```
# github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
exec: "gcc": executable file not found in $PATH
```

## Setup
### Database Session

Import the `upper.io/db.v3/sqlite` package into your application:

```go
// main.go
package main

import (
  "upper.io/db.v3/sqlite"
)
```

Define the `sqlite.ConnectionURL{}` struct:

```go
// ConnectionURL defines the DSN attributes.
type ConnectionURL struct {
  Database string
  Options  map[string]string
}
```

Pass the `sqlite.ConnectionURL` value as argument to `sqlite.Open()` so the `sqlite.Database` session is created.

```go
settings = sqlite.ConnectionURL{
  ...
}

sess, err = sqlite.Open(settings)
...
```

![Note](https://github.com/LizGoro90/db-tour/tree/master/static/img)
> The `sqlite.ParseURL()` function is also provided in case you need to convert the DSN into a `sqlite.ConnectionURL`:

```go
// ParseURL parses a DSN into a ConnectionURL struct.
sqlite.ParseURL(dsn string) (ConnectionURL, error)
```

## Common Database Operations

Once the connection is established, you can start performing operations on the database.

### Example

In the following example, a table named ‘birthday’ consisting of two columns (‘name’ and ‘born’) will be created. Before starting, the table will be searched in the database and, in the event it already exists, it will be removed. Then, three rows will be inserted into the table and checked for accuracy. To this end, the database will be queried and the matches (insertions) will be printed to standard output.

![Note](https://github.com/LizGoro90/db-tour/tree/master/static/img)
> The database operations described above refer to an advanced use of upper-db, hence
they do not follow the exact same patterns of the [tour](https://tour.upper.io/welcome/01) and [getting started](https://upper.io/db.v3/getting-started) page.

The `birthday` table with the `name` and `born` columns is created with these SQL statements:

```sql
--' example.sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "birthday";

CREATE TABLE "birthday" (
  "name" varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  "born" varchar(12) DEFAULT NULL
);
```

Use the `sqlite3` command line tool to create a `example.db`
database file.

```
rm -f example.db
cat example.sql | sqlite3 example.db
```

The Go code below will add some rows to the "birthday" table and then will
print the same rows that were inserted.

```go
// example.go

package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "log"
  "time"
  "upper.io/db.v3/sqlite"
)

var settings = sqlite.ConnectionURL{
  Database: `example.db`, // Path to database file.
}

type Birthday struct {
  // Maps the "Name" property to the "name" column
  // of the "birthday" table.
  Name string `db:"name"`
  // Maps the "Born" property to the "born" column
  // of the "birthday" table.
  Born time.Time `db:"born"`
}

func main() {

  // Attemping to open the "example.db" database file.
  sess, err := sqlite.Open(settings)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("db.Open(): %q\n", err)
  }
  defer sess.Close() // Remember to close the database session.

  // Pointing to the "birthday" table.
  birthdayCollection := sess.Collection("birthday")

  // Attempt to remove existing rows (if any).
  err = birthdayCollection.Truncate()
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Truncate(): %q\n", err)
  }

  // Inserting some rows into the "birthday" table.
  birthdayCollection.Insert(Birthday{
    Name: "Hayao Miyazaki",
    Born: time.Date(1941, time.January, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.Local),
  })

  birthdayCollection.Insert(Birthday{
    Name: "Nobuo Uematsu",
    Born: time.Date(1959, time.March, 21, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.Local),
  })

  birthdayCollection.Insert(Birthday{
    Name: "Hironobu Sakaguchi",
    Born: time.Date(1962, time.November, 25, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.Local),
  })

  // Let's query for the results we've just inserted.
  res := birthdayCollection.Find()

  // Query all results and fill the birthday variable with them.
  var birthdays []Birthday

  err = res.All(&birthdays)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("res.All(): %q\n", err)
  }

  // Printing to stdout.
  for _, birthday := range birthday {
    fmt.Printf("%s was born in %s.\n",
      birthday.Name,
      birthday.Born.Format("January 2, 2006"),
    )
  }
}
```

Running the example above:

```
go run main.go
```

Expected output:

```
Hayao Miyazaki was born in January 5, 1941.
Nobuo Uematsu was born in March 21, 1959.
Hironobu Sakaguchi was born in November 25, 1962.
```

## Unique adapter features

### SQL builder

You can use the [query builder](/db.v3/lib/sqlbuilder) for any complex SQL query:

```go
q := b.Select(
    "p.id",
    "p.title AD publication_title",
    "a.name AS artist_name",
  ).From("artists AS a", "publication AS p").
  Where("a.id = p.author_id")

var publications []Publication
if err = q.All(&publications); err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
```

### Auto-incremental keys

If you want to use auto-increment keys with a SQLite database, you must define
the column type as `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`, like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE foo(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255)
);
```

Remember to set the `omitempty` option to the ID field:

```go
type Foo struct {
  Id    int64   `db:"id,omitempty"`
  Title string  `db:"title"`
}
```

### Using `db.Raw` and `db.Func`

If you need to provide a raw parameter for a method you can use the `db.Raw`
function. Plese note that raw means that the specified value won't be filtered:

```go
res = sess.Find().Select(db.Raw("DISTINCT(name)"))
```

`db.Raw` also works for condition values.

Another useful type that you could use to create an equivalent statement is
`db.Func`:

```go
res = sess.Find().Select(db.Func("DISTINCT", "name"))
```
